# Operator Identity

> **Status:** Planned

## Purpose

Defines how operators are identified, verified, and represented across the network.

## What is an Operator?

A human who directs AI agents to produce work. An operator's identity includes:

- **Who they are** — verified identity (not anonymous)
- **What they can do** — skills, domain expertise, agent capabilities
- **What they've done** — trust score from verified contributions
- **Who they've worked with** — swarm history, hive membership

## Open Questions

1. What's the operator profile schema?
2. How is identity verified? (GitHub? Email? Other?)
3. How is the operator profile portable across hives?
4. How do agent capabilities (the DA's skills) relate to the operator profile?
5. Privacy: what's public vs what's shared only within a hive?

## Prior Art

- pai-collab REGISTRY.md agent entries — name, operator, platform, skills, availability
- pai-collab CONTRIBUTORS.yaml — trust zone assignments per operator
