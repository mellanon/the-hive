# Skill Protocol

> **Status:** Planned

## Purpose

The skill protocol defines how operator capabilities (AI skills) are packaged, published to the network, discovered by other operators, and installed locally.

## What is a Skill?

A downloadable capability for an operator's AI. Like installing expertise — analysis frameworks, security scanning, content filtering, domain-specific workflows.

## Open Questions

1. What's the packaging format for a network-distributable skill?
2. How are skills published to a hive or the wider network?
3. How do operators discover skills? (Registry? Search? Recommendation?)
4. How is skill authorship attributed and verified?
5. How do skill versions and updates propagate?
6. Can skills have dependencies on other skills?

## Prior Art

- PAI skill system — local skill structure with SKILL.md, workflows, components
- pai-collab [skill-enforcer](https://github.com/mellanon/pai-collab) — validates skill structure
- pai-collab SpecFlow — skill specification and development lifecycle
